As ive done many builds prior to this blog going live, i'll document them in the first couple of posts. The build range from 2022 to present day.\n\nThe first real build i did was a pair of compact bookshelf speakers, these were built with 'Amazon special' drivers and an off the shelf crossover, I constructed the cabinets after running the numbers through some basic online calculators... no winISD at this time. I didnt even have the TS params for the 4 inch fiberglass drivers... But they sounded OK, i tweaked the port a couple of times and even though i didnt do the maths proper, i was impressed by the sound. At least i constructed the solid fonts from walut strips and the finish was great for my first build.",
